## 🕹️ How to Play

- Two players take turns rolling a dice.
- On each turn:
  - The player rolls the dice as many times as they want.
  - Each roll adds to their **current score**.
  - If they roll a **1**, their **current score resets**, and it’s the next player’s turn.
  - They can choose to **"Hold"** their score, which adds it to their **total score** and passes the turn.
- The first player to reach **100 points** wins!
